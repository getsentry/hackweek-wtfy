# WTFY - "Was It Fixed Yet?" Implementation Plan

> _Because debugging is hard enough without wondering if you're chasing ghosts from SDK versions past._

## Project Overview

WTFY is an internal Sentry tool that answers the eternal developer question: "Was this bug I'm seeing fixed yet in a newer SDK version?" Because life's too short to manually trawl through changelogs, and way too long to keep debugging issues that someone already solved three releases ago.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### Core Framework

- **SvelteKit** (latest) with **Svelte 5 runes syntax**
- **TypeScript** for type safety (because we're not animals)
- **Vite** for lightning-fast builds

### Styling & UI

- **TailwindCSS** with **Tailwind Forms** plugin
- **Lucide Svelte** for icons (clean and modern)
- **Tailwind Typography** for readable changelog/PR content

### Backend & APIs

- **SvelteKit API routes** (server-side)
- **GitHub REST API** for repository data
- **GitHub GraphQL API** for complex queries (if needed)
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4) for intelligent issue analysis
- **Zod** for API input validation

### Data & State Management

- **PostgreSQL** with **Drizzle ORM** (better for concurrent access and JSON storage)
- **SvelteKit's built-in stores** for client-side state
- Request/response caching with simple file system or memory cache

### Security & Configuration

- Environment variables for API keys
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Simple IP-based access control (if needed)

### Monitoring & Observability

- **Sentry SDK** (dogfooding our own product, naturally)
- Simple logging with structured data

### Deployment

- **Vercel** or **Railway** for application hosting
- **Railway** or **Supabase** for PostgreSQL hosting
- Environment-based configuration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation üèóÔ∏è

**Goal**: Get the basic SvelteKit app running with proper tooling

1. **Initialize SvelteKit project** with TypeScript
2. **Configure TailwindCSS** + Tailwind Forms + Lucide icons
3. **Set up Sentry monitoring** and error tracking
4. **Configure environment variables** for API keys
5. **Set up Drizzle ORM** with PostgreSQL database
6. **Create basic project structure** and routing

**Deliverables**:

- Working SvelteKit app with proper styling
- PostgreSQL database schema defined
- Sentry integration active

### Phase 2: Core API Development üîß

**Goal**: Build the intelligent issue analysis engine

1. **Design database schema** for:
   - Requests (issue description, SDK, version, timestamp)
   - Results (analysis, PRs found, fix status, confidence score)
   - Cache (GitHub data, changelog info with JSON storage)

2. **Implement GitHub integration**:
   - Fetch SDK repository information
   - Get commits/tags between versions
   - Retrieve PR details and descriptions
   - Handle rate limiting and caching

3. **Build OpenAI integration**:
   - Analyze issue descriptions
   - Compare against changelog entries
   - Identify relevant fixes
   - Generate summaries

4. **Create main API route** (`/api/analyze`):
   - Input validation with Zod
   - Orchestrate GitHub + AI analysis
   - Cache results to avoid duplicate work
   - Return structured response

**Deliverables**:

- Working API that can analyze issues against changelogs
- Proper error handling and rate limiting
- Cached results for performance

### Phase 3: User Interface üé®

**Goal**: Create the simple, functional UI for submitting requests

1. **Main form page** (`/`):
   - SDK selection dropdown (pre-populated list)
   - Version input with validation
   - Issue description textarea
   - Submit button with loading states

2. **Results display**:
   - Clear "Fixed" or "Still an issue" status
   - List of relevant PRs with links
   - Short fix summaries
   - Confidence indicators

3. **Error handling UI**:
   - Friendly error messages
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Loading skeletons

4. **Responsive design**:
   - Mobile-friendly (because developers debug on their phones too)
   - Dark/light mode support

**Deliverables**:

- Functional form for issue submission
- Clear results presentation
- Error states and loading indicators

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features üöÄ

**Goal**: Add quality-of-life improvements and polish

1. **Request history/logs**:
   - Previous requests list
   - Filter and search functionality
   - Export capabilities

2. **Advanced analysis features**:
   - Multiple SDK version comparison
   - Related issue detection
   - False positive reduction

3. **Admin features** (if needed):
   - Usage analytics
   - API key management
   - Cache management

4. **Authentication** (optional):
   - GitHub OAuth for user tracking
   - Request history per user
   - Rate limiting per user

**Deliverables**:

- Request history functionality
- Enhanced analysis capabilities
- Admin tools (if needed)

### Phase 5: Polish & Deployment üéØ

**Goal**: Production-ready application with monitoring

1. **Performance optimization**:
   - API response caching
   - Database indexing
   - Bundle size optimization

2. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for core logic
   - E2E tests for main user flows
   - API endpoint testing

3. **Documentation**:
   - Usage guide for internal users
   - API documentation
   - Deployment guide

4. **Production deployment**:
   - Environment setup
   - Monitoring dashboards
   - Backup strategies

**Deliverables**:

- Production-ready application
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation and monitoring

## Technical Considerations

### AI Analysis Strategy

- Use structured prompts to analyze issue descriptions
- Compare against commit messages and PR descriptions
- Implement confidence scoring for recommendations
- Handle edge cases (ambiguous descriptions, missing changelogs)

### GitHub API Optimization

- Implement smart caching for repository data
- Use GraphQL for complex queries to minimize requests
- Handle rate limits gracefully with exponential backoff
- Cache parsed changelogs and commit data

### Database Design

```sql
-- Simplified PostgreSQL schema concept
requests: id, sdk, version, description, created_at
results: id, request_id, status, confidence, summary, prs (jsonb), created_at
cache: key, data (jsonb), expires_at
```

### Error Handling Strategy

- Graceful degradation when APIs are unavailable
- Clear error messages for users
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff

## Success Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 10 seconds for analysis
- **Accuracy**: High confidence recommendations verified by users
- **Usage**: Adoption by Sentry internal teams
- **Performance**: Minimal API rate limit issues

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- Integration with Sentry's internal issue tracking
- Slack bot interface for quick queries
- Historical trending analysis
- Multi-language SDK support
- Machine learning for improved accuracy
